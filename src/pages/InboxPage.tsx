We're looking at switching to bag-in-box for our soda gun program and want to know your per-unit pricing on the 3-gallon BIB format. What's the minimum order quantity, and what's the typical lead time from order to delivery? We'd love to get set up as a wholesale account if the numbers work.",
    draft: "Hey Mike — thanks for reaching out, and glad to hear the Ginger Beer has been working well in your Mules. For the 3-gallon BIB format, we're at $135 per unit with a 6-unit minimum on first orders. Lead time is typically 5–7 business days from order confirmation. I'd love to send you a free sample of our Tonic Water BIB as well — it pairs great with the gin programs most Austin bars are running right now. Let me know where to ship and I'll get it out this week.\n\nHave the best day of your life,\nShane McKnight · Top Hat Provisions",
